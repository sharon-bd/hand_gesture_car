## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the requirements for the Hand Gesture Car Control System, a Python application that allows users to control a virtual car using hand gestures captured through a webcam.

### 1.2 Scope
The Hand Gesture Car Control System is an interactive application that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect hand movements and translate them into car controls in a virtual environment. The system includes:

- Real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe
- A virtual car simulation with physics-based movement
- Game elements including obstacles and scoring
- Sound effects that respond to actions
- Multiple difficulty modes
- Camera selection interface

The application can be used for entertainment, hand-eye coordination training, or as a tech demonstration for hand gesture recognition.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Hand Gesture Car Control System is a standalone application but is designed with a modular architecture that separates the hand detection, car control, and game interface components. This design allows for future expansion, such as connecting to a physical car or integrating with other systems.

The system uses the webcam to capture hand movements, processes these movements to extract control data, and applies these controls to a virtual car in a game environment. The game includes obstacles, scoring, and different difficulty modes.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The main functions of the system include:

- **Hand tracking and gesture recognition**: Detect hand landmarks and recognize gestures
- **Control translation**: Convert detected gestures into control signals
- **Virtual car simulation**: A physics-based car model that responds to controls
- **Obstacle generation**: Create and manage road obstacles
- **Sound effects**: Generate and play appropriate sound effects
- **Game mechanics**: Scoring, collisions, and game modes
- **User interface**: Menus, status displays, and control settings

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The intended users of this system include:

- Casual users interested in gesture-based interfaces
- Gaming enthusiasts
- Students or professionals learning about computer vision and gesture recognition
- Demonstrators showcasing computer vision technology

No special technical expertise is required to use the application, though users should be comfortable with basic computer operations and have normal hand mobility.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The application runs on standard desktop or laptop computers with the following requirements:

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Minimum 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)
- Webcam with minimum 640x480 resolution
- Processor: Dual-core 2 GHz or better
- Python 3.7 or higher with required packages

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
The following constraints apply to the system design and implementation:

- Real-time processing requirements for hand detection
- Limited by webcam quality and lighting conditions
- Frame rate must remain above 30 FPS for responsive controls
- Dependency on third-party libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyGame)
- Python language performance limitations

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Component Diagram
The system consists of the following main components:

1. **Hand Detection Module**: Handles webcam input and detects hand gestures
2. **Car Control Module**: Translates gestures into car control commands
3. **Game Engine**: Manages the game environment, obstacles, and physics
4. **Sound Manager**: Controls audio feedback
5. **User Interface**: Provides visual feedback and menu systems

These components interact in a pipeline: hand gestures are detected, translated to controls, applied to the car, and the game state is updated and rendered with appropriate sounds.

### 3.2 Directory Structure
The application follows a modular directory structure:
